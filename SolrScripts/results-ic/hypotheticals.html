<li><b>Comment:</b><br>I can't imagine that it would be... and code search turns up few hits for "icecreamsandwich". But I'll do as you recommend, depending on where it gets checked in.</li><br><br>

<li><b>Comment:</b><br>this seems like a bad idea. there are only two callers and they pass the addresses of globals. i can't imagine any circumstance under which you'd want this function to be a no-op.</li><br><br>

<li><b>Comment:</b><br>Everything above is used to calculate/parse/sniff all the pieces from the incoming dmesg line buffer and generate the internal log buffer format:

<pri><tag>\0<message>\0

All the vars would have to passed to a break-out function:

pri
now
uid
pid
tid
message (buf, tag, l)
length

I can not imagine the break-out to result in anything that looks less complicated.

The above parse/sniff routines are far better candidates for break-out. I will try that, and make this section look more linear.</li><br><br>

<li><b>Comment:</b><br>I am glad you broached this question. I have had troubles engaging anyone on how to architect this.

This #ifdef is to prevent the definition of this method if one does not include the private API. This file is being cultivate/curated to be _the_ Vendor API.

If a class can completely be defined inline, it can be used by a vendor. If I implement that class details in a library, we can not allow a vendor to use it because its shape carries the risk of changing from release to release. (I should add a comment at the top of the class to 'spain that goal)

The options are:

- two classes, one with, and one without. The one with in private Is-A of the one without defined here. (Google coding standard asks that we stay away from Is-A and implement Has-A instead which will be exceedingly noisy)
- Make this a public API. (However, I do not feel comfortable making android_log_write_list_buffer vendor public)
- forgo adding this to the class, leave the android_log_write_list_buffer private, native, and C. (works too, class operator to return android_log_context reference)

NB: there will be exactly _one_ internal user of this API. I can not imagine more, but imagination should not stifle planning.</li><br><br>
