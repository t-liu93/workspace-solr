I think that the two comments need to be merged into one before the loop, explaining why it's unnecessary to clear the top 4 bits within the loop, as long as they're cleared at the end.\n\nAlso, this optimization probably fails if ints aren't 32-bit, and it'd be good to at least mention that and possibly to enforce it with a proper fixed-length type."]},
