	"message":["Patch Set 1: Code-Review+1\n\nI'm not opposed to this patch, but generally speaking I'd like a way to rebuild past versions of the kernel sources reliably, and this is making it a little bit difficult.\n\nI wonder what's the best way to achieve that, then ?\n\n1) Put build-kernel.sh in kernel/goldfish.git, so it will follow the same branching scheme. On the other hand, it depends on prebuilt toolchains that come from AOSP, so there is still potential for mismatch (as currently should I note).\n\n2) Add options or additionnal detection code to build-kernel.sh to deal with previous/older sources\n\nWhat do you think?"]},
