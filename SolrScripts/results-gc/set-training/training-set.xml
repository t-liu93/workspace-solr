LGTM overall.

One thing that might be worth emphasizing is that NDK gcc and platform gcc are built from the same source tree, so any changes need to be tested with both the NDK and platform. Not sure if that belongs in your blurb on in the toolchain/gcc/Readme.</message>

Worked for me on Ubuntu 14.04.  Did not work for me on Fedora 20, but that's not a supported build host OS.  Seems that Ubuntu has a libpcre.so.3 that is being picked up as a dependency for your prebuilt libselinux.so.1 and Fedora only has libpcre.so.1, not sure why/if they truly differ in ABI.</message>
