	<li><b>Comment:</b> <br>I just tested this on a shamu-eng build, and this patch works for me. system_server starts fine and there are no SELinux denials being generated. /proc/PID/maps doesn't show any non-file based executable memory either.
	It appears that dex2oat is run unconditionally from zygote to generate system_server's files, so system_server itself never runs in a JITed mode.
	Am I misunderstanding something?</li>

Thanks Eric for your code review +2!
It seems Deckard is not actively working these days to verify patches but I've confirmed the patch merges, builds and works fine in my latest aosp environment.
If you are fine with the change, could you kindly add verified+1 and submit?</li>

Aart, sorry if my previous message was not clear, but this CL has
been superseded by https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/251850/
and https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/266395/ :)
Ah, my oversight! But it seems my suggestion still applies :-)</li>

	<li><b>Comment:</b> <br>Patch Set 1:
writepid is perfect; however I don't think this will work as written.
if I understand this correctly, there's a race between writing the pid and executing the service. as a result, there is a possibility that the child process may have created its own thread before the writepid is finished, resulting in that worker thread not being included in the appropriate cpuset. this is bad.
can we make the child process write its own pid instead of the parent?</li>

I was able to stage this change locally here:
http://claym.mtv.corp.google.com:8090/source/initializing.html#installing-required-packages-ubuntu-1204
I will do that in the future for these changes to help us root out issues. I didn't understand I could readily cherry-pick from AOSP.
Please just let me know when these changes should go to staging and production. Thanks.</li>
