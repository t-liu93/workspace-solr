Reviewers (and experts in LatinIME and l18n): how practical is it going to be to merge this into our internal tree in a way that won't get stomped over by any l18n scripts?##### #####

Thanks, that took care of it.

FWIW, the build failure was on the linux-host side of things, which means that it's only visible on linux, and might not even exist on all configurations.##### #####

The artwork is not suitable for the current platform style (and is also missing several densities) but maybe it's best re-drawn by our artists.

Do you have reference material for the required presentation of the HAC feature?##### #####

Hi,

Thanks for your submission. Could you explain the purpose of this patch and the differences with the current data?##### #####

a35f09b5e35a8634bbc8b798bd93ccdabc4d578f#####Patch Set 1:

Actually, this also adds a public API, so the relevant file (current.txt) needs to be updated accordingly (this breaks the build otherwise).##### #####

The coding guidelines say

http://source.android.com/submit-patches/code-style-guide#indentation

Thus, line wraps are indented by 8 spaces.

Jon, sorry again for the confusion, you might want to add Dave Bort to

Yup, that's the right branch. However, we don't really need to record branching details between eclair and master in the long-term, so that'd be better in a review comment than in the commit description itself.##### #####

unfortunately this change fails to merge on top of the latest head and can't be submitted as-is. If it's still relevant, please resolve the conflicts and upload a replacement. Sorry for the very long delay.##### #####

Unfortunately this fails to merge again, as opencore has been changing since the original submission.

Because there are a few high-level issues to resolve first (i.e. sourcing a FLAC library), it might not immediately make sense to resolve these conflicts.##### #####
