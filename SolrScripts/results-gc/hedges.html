Maybe we can change heap max free to ensure that we don't overflow the allocation stack, this would have the benefit of no added overhead.</li>

Only caveats are that the current android selinux docs say to use permissive_or_unconfined() for new domain development, and if we provide no definition of unconfined, then they may try to roll their own which could be worse.  However, I suppose we could just have them use userdebug_or_eng(`permissive foo;') instead or perhaps provide a simpler macro that does that, and if they do try to roll their own unconfined domain, it can't break any of the neverallows so it should be ok.</li>

	<li><b>Comment:</b><br> Patch Set 1: No score; I would prefer that you didn't submit this
The way this is solved in the rest of the code is to prefix strings that might start with "-" with "x". This is a practice that is explicitly recommended in the POSIX spec, IIRC. And there is an example of it one line up, even!</li>

LGTM, though I doubt we're going to see Cupcake-based x86 devices in the near future.</li>

Shouldn't this have a BROKEN_BUILD tag so we can submit it right now, and remove it when the compiler is fixed?</li>
